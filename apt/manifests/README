DESCRIPTION:
This module installs and manages apt.
You should run this in a stage before Main to take full advantage of it.

You can include subclasses in the same way to enforce ordering

class varnish {
  class { 'apt::varnish': stage => 'pre' }
  include varnish::params, varnish::install, varnish::config, varnish::service
}
